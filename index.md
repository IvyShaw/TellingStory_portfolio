# Xiaoyu Shi's Portfolio
Hey there! Welcome. 
This is my portfolio for the CMU Course Telling Story with Data. Here, I will document my learning process and coursework, including data visualization critique, workshop materials, and my final project. The link is [here]( https://ivyshaw.github.io/TellingStory_portfolio/)

## About me
I'm a graduating master student from METALS Program, Human-Computer Interaction Institute @ Carnegie Mellon University. During the WFH period, I worked, played and worked out at home. This has already been the **fourth** month since I started to workout everyday!
<br>Before I changed my career path to **UX Design**, I was a tech person who engaged in learning Computer Science. I dedicate in not only developing good tools for people, but also designing the ways that it can benefit people.

My name **Xiaoyu** pronouns as similar as **Shall you**. You may call my English name Ivy as well.

## My interests
I like innovation more than conventions. For example, I enjoy creating new dishes in my kitchen and hate follow the recipes (although it's the primary learning resource for cooking. Besides, I'm interested in writing stories more than reading novels.
In terms of this course, I hope to build my aesthetics in data visualization and learn how to design data formats for presentation. I believe it will empower my deisgn capability in data area.

## My career plan
I'm hunting jobs that are related to UX Designer now! If you are interested in my work, feel free to contact me.

Goal of the visualization: Compare between countries & highlight United States, United Kingdom and Canada

Upon the above three charts, Chart 1 utilized map to make the geographical information obvious, and make contrast between countries through the size of dots. Chart 2 grouped the Debt-to-GDP values by countries using a line to display yearly changes. Chart 3 ranks the Debt-to-GDP values from high to low, and uses a filter to select a specific year.

My goal of the third visualization is to display the comparison of Debt-to-GDP values between countries and emphasize the countries who have larger values. Given by the large set of data, I want to reduce the amount of information that readers need to focus on. Therefore, I chose Hierarchy Chart that shows the most important information at the top and least important ones at the bottom. The primary countries (USA, Canada and UK) that I want to compare are displayed by three different colors. Other countries are colored with a less bright gray. What to do next: I want to set the default year to 2018 which is the latest data. Second, color the developed countries with the darker gray and developing countries in a lighter gray.

# Xiaoyu Shi's Portfolio
Hey there! Welcome. 
This is my portfolio for the CMU Course Telling Story with Data. Here, I will document my learning process and coursework, including data visualization critique, workshop materials, and my final project.

## About me
I'm a graduating master student from METALS Program, Human-Computer Interaction Institute @ Carnegie Mellon University. During the WFH period, I worked, played and worked out at home. This has already been the **fourth** month since I started to workout everyday.
Before I changed my career path to **UX Design**, I was a tech person who engaged in learning Computer Science. I dedicate in not only developing good tools for people, but also designing the ways that it can benefit people.

My name **Xiaoyu** pronouns as similar as **Shall you**. You may call my English name Ivy as well.

## My interests
I like innovation more than conventions. For example, I enjoy creating new dishes in my kitchen and hate follow the recipes (although it's the primary learning resource for cooking. Besides, I'm interested in writing stories more than reading novels.
In terms of this course, I hope to build my asethestics in data visualization and learn how to design data formats for presentation. I believe it will empower my deisgn capability in data area.

## My career plan
I'm hunting jobs that are related to UX Designer now! If you are interested in my work, feel free to contact with me.

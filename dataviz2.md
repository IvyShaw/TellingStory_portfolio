Goal of the visualization: Compare between countries & highlight United States, United Kingdom and Canada

Upon the above three charts, Chart 1 utilized map to make the geographical information obvious, and make contrast between countries through the size of dots. Chart 2 grouped the Debt-to-GDP values by countries using a line to display yearly changes. Chart 3 ranks the Debt-to-GDP values from high to low, and uses a filter to select a specific year.

My goal of the third visualization is to display the comparison of Debt-to-GDP values between countries and emphasize the countries who have larger values. Given by the large set of data, I want to reduce the amount of information that readers need to focus on. Therefore, I chose Hierarchy Chart that shows the most important information at the top and least important ones at the bottom. The primary countries (USA, Canada and UK) that I want to compare are displayed by three different colors. Other countries are colored with a less bright gray. What to do next: I want to set the default year to 2018 which is the latest data. Second, color the developed countries with the darker gray and developing countries in a lighter gray.
